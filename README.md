# mtcc: music torrent content creator
#### The quick and easy way to create and share your music torrents!

## Features

- **Easy to Use**: Simply upload your chosen album and mtcc will generate a downloadable NFO and a presentation for the album that can be copied in one click. No need to provide any additional information.

mtcc is a user-friendly tool designed for content creators to easily upload a music torrent. The application includes an NFO builder and a presentation generator in BBCode format, all accessible through a Streamlit web page.

Simply upload the album of your choice and mtcc will generate a downloadable NFO as well as a presentation for the album that can be copied in one click, without the need to provide any additional information.

mtcc uses [MediaInfo](https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo) to extract data from audio files, ensuring that 100% of the information in the NFO is reliable.
